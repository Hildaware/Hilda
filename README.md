## Hilda is a plugin for [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) in conjunction with [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) with an aim to teach players how to play combat Jobs with very little prior knowledge.

### Hilda was created to replicate the experience of popular World of Warcraft addon [Hekili](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hekili), but with a larger focus on the pre-level cap experience.

## Current Status
***
### Hilda is currently in public _Alpha_ status.
This means it's in the very early stages of being used by the community. Expect bugs, Default Sets being a bit wonky (especially multi-target sets).

## What Hilda Is
***
- An action priority helper plugin which makes predictions accurately upwards of 20 steps ahead in the future. It builds upon a predictive system which emulates multiple combat [Conditions](https://seljcql.github.io/Hilda/breakdown/conditions/) to recommend the best possible actions to use in the player's current situation.
- Displays action icons in a row as a suggestion of what action you should use in the current situation.
- Provides built-in _**Default Sets**_ which aim to replicate the common flow of combat for that particular job.
  - These _**Default Sets**_ are currently in testing and constantly changing based on feedback. They are originally made by developers with very little knowledge of the current level cap's mechanics for each and every job.
  - _**Default Sets**_ are provided via HTTPS to the plugin itself to provide constant updates to the sets without requiring an update to the plugin. They will get updated locally for each user upon the plugin loading or restarting.
- 100% customizable
  - _**Default Sets**_ provide something, but may not provide what you want. Hilda allows for easy creation of priority sets via its [GUI](https://seljcql.github.io/Hilda/gui-overview/).

## What Hilda Is NOT
***
- It will **_NOT_** play the game for you.
- It will **_NOT_** blindly increase your Duty dps by 10%.
  - Unless you're jumping into a duty with no prior knowledge of how the job plays, then I would hope it would help.
- Hilda is currently not open source due to concerns of abuse of the code. (Open source is being considered)


## How to Contribute
***
- Hilda was created and is being maintained by 2 people and took a large amount of hours to initially develop and maintain.
  - We are currently not open source, and helping with the development of the plugin itself is not possible.
- _**Default Sets**_ are constantly in need of updating, adjusting, etc. and are fully modifiable by the community.
  - [Create an Issue](https://github.com/SelJCQL/Hilda/issues) regarding a problem with a Default Set.
  - [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/JzrMWYT7ay) to get community help or discussions.

## The Future of Hilda
***
- Addition of a Teaching Mode
  - Shows a window with descriptions of the current action, why it's being used in this situation, etc.
- Translations to other languages.
  - Hilda has quite a few English only explanations in its configuration. We'll probably need to rely on the community for help on this.
- Support for Disciple of the Hands? (...maybe)
- Support for PvP actions
- Support for Items
- ... and many more!
